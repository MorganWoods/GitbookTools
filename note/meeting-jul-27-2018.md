  关于会议和期刊的时间

  After the result of Conference come out, I submit to Journal.

* 会议的排版,图片,公式的建议.

  About the format, do these figures and plot suit the paper.

* 核心原理

  I insert the dueling network frame into AC network frame. I hope the dueling 's advantage can promote a better Q evaluation for guiding critic network choose actions. From the experiment results shows ,it has a light stabler . so I want to deep into more about this idea in continuous control field.

* 期刊内容讲解

  This Journal paper origin from the Conference I showed you before. In this paper, I add an experiment to test the algorithm's performance and discuss the probability of application of my method in robotics field, or navigation. I wanna build relationship to real application.well, at first I wanna implement my method in environment like gazebo, it looks like this ,

  Its a popular RL environment for robotics, as you see , its much vivid and it base on pyshics formula theory, which imitate the real robotic. sensors are lasers and action fileld is continuous. But, unfortunately, it running with some problems I cannot sovle. So I have to abandon it for a short time ,

   during this period , I found another environment whic wroten by a group of chinese. This environment share many common ground with gazebo. continuous action filed. lasers input, robotic roaming in a maze. So I 'd like try my method in this simple environment.

  Fig 4 is the application scenario, actually I manually modify the origin screenshot to make it similar like the gazebo, from a 2d environment to 3d environment. I do it because I want to show the real application and make it vivid, meanwile, do not change any core principle of the environment, like the way robotic collect info from maze , robotic roaming style , and the path shape. I am not sure whether it is feasible\(可行的\) modefying it. well the origin screenshot like this:

the info sensors scanning way is in a flat plane\(平面\), I can understand it as a 2d plane , while even in real world robots, the way sensors scanning in a flat plane too. so, I modiefy it .

also, during this period , I probability try gazebo too, I think I need to wait the result of Conference and then submit to journal, since I notice some restrictions of journal submission rules.

* 博士后

  recruit postdoctor

* turtlebot

  I need to schedule my time resonable , so I decide not think about using real robot now. since I have to spend much time work on papers and knowledge, and the virtual environment is much more easygoing with python code. while to the turtlebot , I need extra time to do research in robot code ,like c ++ and hardware debuging. so ,I feel I should put off the working on turtlebot, maybe in future.
