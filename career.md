Our goal is Real AI: artificial intelligence that is able to work with humans and augment human capabilities to operate in a complex world. To ensure the sustainable, long-term development of Finnish industry and society, the Real AI needs to be built with Real People in the Real World. To achieve this, FCAI and Finland need to be an integral part of the international community.

#### NEXT-GENERATION DATA-EFFICIENT DEEP LEARNING

Contributes to objectives **I** and **III** by developing methods that harness the power of deep learning. These methods include semi-supervised learning, few-shot learning for making use of auxiliary sources of training data, and learning models that can be reliably used in simulator-based inference. The goal is to achieve high-quality results with scarce training data and only limited human supervision.
