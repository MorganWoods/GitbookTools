#### NEXT-GENERATION DATA-EFFICIENT DEEP LEARNING

Contributes to objectives **I** and **III** by developing methods that harness the power of deep learning. These methods include semi-supervised learning, few-shot learning for making use of auxiliary sources of training data, and learning models that can be reliably used in simulator-based inference. The goal is to achieve high-quality results with scarce training data and only limited human supervision.
