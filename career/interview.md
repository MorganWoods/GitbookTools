# Interview

## English ðŸŒ€

do you have any questions for us?

Ask questions like:

* Do you have any examples of projects that I would be working on if I were to be offered the job? This shows that youâ€™re interested in the actual job and not just being employed.
* What is the typical day for this **position** \(job\)? Find out what kind of duties are involved and what kind of things you would be expected to do on a day-to-day basis.
* Does the company offer in-house training to staff? This shows your interest in not only getting the job, but also wanting to improve and grow.
* What is the next step? Here, this is a way of asking what is next in the interview process. They will tell you how many days it will take to make their decision and will inform you if you need to come back for a second interview.
